There are a few things to consider when building modern applications:

- **User Interface** - how users will consume and interact with the application
- **Routing** - how users navigate between different parts of the application
- **Data Fetching** - where the data lives and how to get it
- **Rendering** - when and where to render static or dynamic content
- **Integrations** - what third-party services to use (CMS, auth, payments, etc) and how to connect to them
- **Infrastructure** - where to deploy, store, and run the application code (Serverless, CDN, Edge, etc)
- **Performance** - how to optimize the application for end-users
- **Scalability** - how the application adapts as the team, data, and traffic grow
- **Developer Experience** - the teamâ€™s experience building and maintaining the application

For each part of the application, the developers need to decide whether to build a solution themselves or use other tools such as libraries and frameworks.
