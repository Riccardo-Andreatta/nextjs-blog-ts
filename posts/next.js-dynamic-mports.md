Next.js supports lazy loading external libraries with `import()` and React components with `next/dynamic`.

It is also possible to dynamically load a component on the client side, just by disabling the `ssr` option. This is useful if an external dependency or component relies on browser APIs.

Components or libraries are only imported and included in the JavaScript bundle when theyâ€™re used by the users.

Deferred loading helps improve the initial loading performance by decreasing the amount of JavaScript necessary to render the page.
