**Next.js** is an open-source, *flexible React framework* (created and maintained by **Vercel**) that gives us building blocks to create fast web applications.

This means that Next.js *handles the tooling and configuration needed for React*, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for the application (such as building tools, routing, customizable components, etc).

In easy words, Next.js is enabling React-based web applications with *server-side rendering build option* and it is also *generating static websites*. Where traditional React applications can only render their content in the client-side browser, Next.js extends this functionality to include applications rendered on the server-side.
