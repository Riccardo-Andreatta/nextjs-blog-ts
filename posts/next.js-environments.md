Next.js provides features for both the **development** and **production** stages of an application.

- In the **development stage**, Next.js optimizes for the developer and their experience building the application. It comes with features such as TypeScript and ESLint integration, Fast Refresh, and more.

- In the **production stage**, Next.js optimizes for the end-users and their experience using the application. It aims to transform the code to make it performant and accessible by bundling the necessary code to reduce the number of requests for files when a user visits a web page.
